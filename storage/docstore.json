The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels\naccounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure\non gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price\nand performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many\nof the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and\ninfringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous\nsoftware applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security\nfeatures), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nSM\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The\nCompany faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have signi\ufb01cant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\nestablished hardware, software, and service o\ufb00erings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-\npriced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\nproduct margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no pro\ufb01t or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s\nservices compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The\nCompany faces signi\ufb01cant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to o\ufb00er integrated\nsolutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single\nor limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom\ncomponents available from only one source.

The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets,\nwearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom\ncomponents available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields\nhave matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be a\ufb00ected if\nsuppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends\nheavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely \ufb02ow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to\ndevelop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services.\nThis includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company\nbelieves the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in di\ufb00erentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such\nownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly \ufb01les patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing,\nand is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual\nproperty rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services.

Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and stock price can be a\ufb00ected by a number of factors, whether currently known or\nunknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and \ufb01nancial condition, past \ufb01nancial performance should not\nbe considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This\ndiscussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend signi\ufb01cantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global\nsupply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a\nresult, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including in\ufb02ation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tari\ufb00s and other barriers to trade, changes to \ufb01scal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency \ufb02uctuations can adversely impact consumer con\ufb01dence and spending and\nmaterially adversely a\ufb00ect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.

Potential\neffects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative\ncounterparties and other \ufb01nancial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s\n\ufb01nancial instruments.

Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place\norders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely a\ufb00ected and could in the future materially adversely impact the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations, \ufb01nancial condition and stock price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and\nmanufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that a\ufb00ected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could\noccur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services in affected areas.\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The\nextent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s operational and \ufb01nancial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors\noutside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability,\ndistribution and e\ufb00ectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy\nand demand for consumer products and services.

Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located\nprimarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international con\ufb02icts can result in\ntari\ufb00s, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, particularly if these measures occur\nin regions where the Company derives a signi\ufb01cant portion of its revenues and/or has signi\ufb01cant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S.\nand China have led to a series of tari\ufb00s being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tari\ufb00s increase the cost of\nthe Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the\nCompany earns on its products. Tari\ufb00s can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less\ncompetitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could\nadversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to o\ufb00er its products and services as designed. These measures can\nrequire the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to o\ufb00er third-party applications on its\nplatforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to e\ufb00ectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. If disputes and con\ufb02icts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be signi\ufb01cantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business.

Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a\nnegative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that\nare prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by \ufb01re, power shortages, nuclear\npower plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health\nissues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of\nnatural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense e\ufb00ects. Such events can make it di\ufb03cult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver\nproducts to its customers, create delays and ine\ufb03ciencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s\nservice o\ufb00erings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience signi\ufb01cant expenditures to resume\noperations, and lose signi\ufb01cant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a\nbusiness interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required\nto maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the\nCompany\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely\na\ufb00ected, and could in the future materially adversely a\ufb00ect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the\nimposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products\nbetween regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and\ndelays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are o\ufb00ered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies", "doc_id": "07b56ac3-245e-4687-bfb0-f4453e71d74c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "80cd9c2bc13878a31cce190c029940c679e9c036b42bfd77837562db0d7b7e7b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 38266, "end": 42489}, "relationships": {"1": "bf11b2a7-9b62-4e6a-902a-e38dec30e0e4", "2": "d3e47299-43ff-4164-8791-c4d96cf4bcfe", "3": "67cf3f9a-7a8c-40bc-a670-f40d93a9affa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "67cf3f9a-7a8c-40bc-a670-f40d93a9affa": {"__data__": {"text": "coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are o\ufb00ered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous\nsoftware applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make signi\ufb01cant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will\nachieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a signi\ufb01cant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks\nand copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating\nthe Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. E\ufb00ective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the\nCompany\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these\nmarkets from companies that have signi\ufb01cant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content\nsupplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices.\nCompetition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources,\nexperience or cost structures to provide products at little or no pro\ufb01t or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time\nexperienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces signi\ufb01cant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to\no\ufb00er solutions that are more competitive than those they currently o\ufb00er. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s\napproach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have signi\ufb01cant resources and experience and have established service\no\ufb00erings with large customer bases.

There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete\neffectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and\nservices.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, e\ufb00ectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services,\nand successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a\nnumber of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up\nissues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the e\ufb00ective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with\nanticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products\nand services may have quality or other defects or de\ufb01ciencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions\nof products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located\noutside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India,\nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a signi\ufb01cant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners,\noften in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve signi\ufb01cant risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the\nCompany\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse e\ufb00ect on the quality\nor quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s \ufb02exibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements\nwith these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and\nout-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its\npartners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners\nprimarily located in Asia, for \ufb01nal assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative\nimpact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or \ufb01nished goods.

While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and \ufb01nished goods, if these outsourcing\npartners or suppliers experience severe \ufb01nancial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the\nrecoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to signi\ufb01cant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and signi\ufb01cant commodity pricing \ufb02uctuations\nthat can materially adversely a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and \ufb01nancial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is\nexperiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely a\ufb00ected, and could materially adversely a\ufb00ect, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain su\ufb03cient\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many\ncomponents, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may su\ufb00er\nfrom poor \ufb01nancial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to\nobtain su\ufb03cient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those o\ufb00ered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware\nor software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into\nspecialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service o\ufb00erings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service\nslowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can\nbe no assurance the Company will be able to detect and \ufb01x all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it o\ufb00ers. Failure to do so can result in\nwidespread technical and performance issues a\ufb00ecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims,\nrecalls, product replacements or modi\ufb01cations, write-o\ufb00s of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and signi\ufb01cant warranty and other\nexpenses, including litigation costs and regulatory \ufb01nes. Quality problems can also adversely a\ufb00ect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services,\nand result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new\nproduct and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net\nrealizable value.

If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset\nexceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently\nrecoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of\nproduct obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations\ncover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile,\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insu\ufb03cient\namounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights\nof others. From time to time, the Company has been noti\ufb01ed that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on\nexperience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable\nterms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or\nservices, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services.\nThere can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products.

This analysis may be\nbased on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product\nsales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market\nshare. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and\noperating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their\napplications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatis\ufb01ed\ncustomers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they\ngenerate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time\nto time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make\nfurther business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The\nCompany is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the\nfuture result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages\ndistribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If\nthe rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results\nof operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms,\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to o\ufb00er their digital content to customers.

Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international\nprivacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.

For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s\nproducts and services vary signi\ufb01cantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of\nfactors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures;\nincreased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages;\npotential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the\nCompany\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs e\ufb00ectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix,\nincluding to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service o\ufb00erings; \ufb02uctuations in foreign exchange rates; in\ufb02ation and\nother macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other\nfactors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its \ufb01rst quarter compared to other quarters in its \ufb01scal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand.\nAdditionally, new product and service introductions can signi\ufb01cantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a\nsigni\ufb01cant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could signi\ufb01cantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could\nalso be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service\nintroductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing\npartners.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating\nexpenses worldwide.

The Program does not obligate the\nCompany to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24, 2022, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to\nincrease its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of \ufb01nancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s\ndiscussion and analysis of its \ufb01nancial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that a\ufb00ect\nthe amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Signi\ufb01cant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K\ndescribes the signi\ufb01cant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated \ufb01nancial statements. Management bases its\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves signi\ufb01cant\njudgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the \ufb01nal\noutcome of these uncertainties will not be di\ufb00erent from that which is re\ufb02ected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a\nmaterial impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The\nCompany records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires signi\ufb01cant\njudgment.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its\nunderlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the e\ufb00ective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the\nexposures, there can be no assurance these positions will o\ufb00set more than a portion of the \ufb01nancial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or\ninterest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the\nunderlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to\nglobal interest rate \ufb02uctuations, it is most a\ufb00ected by \ufb02uctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates a\ufb00ect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s\ndebt.\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a\ncombination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly\nrated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be\ninvestment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the\nCompany\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the\ninvestment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, a\nhypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of\nthe portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding \ufb01xed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding \ufb02oating- and \ufb01xed-rate notes\nwith varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into\ninterest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to e\ufb00ectively convert \ufb01xed-rate payments into\n\ufb02oating-rate payments or \ufb02oating-rate payments into \ufb01xed-rate payments.

Interest rate swaps allow the Company to e\ufb00ectively convert \ufb01xed-rate payments into\n\ufb02oating-rate payments or \ufb02oating-rate payments into \ufb01xed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally o\ufb00set by the corresponding losses and gains\non the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September 24,\n2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar, will negatively a\ufb00ect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local\ncurrency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with \ufb01nancial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain\nexisting assets and liabilities, certain \ufb01rmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash \ufb02ows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company\nhas entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially o\ufb00set the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013\ndenominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases,\ntypically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting\nconsiderations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a\nsensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of \ufb02uctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte\nCarlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a\ngiven con\ufb01dence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent\nactual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, \ufb01rm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% con\ufb01dence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of\n$1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021. Because the Company uses\nforeign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally o\ufb00set by increases in the fair value of the\nunderlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may di\ufb00er materially from the sensitivity analyses\nperformed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and", "doc_id": "8b1fa667-1b46-4481-8836-025d06554baf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "47ec1612c9914a121b5d347c966850e6c6652c78cc8d1e488de13ccec2f4a6ed", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 146957, "end": 150925}, "relationships": {"1": "bf11b2a7-9b62-4e6a-902a-e38dec30e0e4", "2": "f7bc3cb7-da89-4c7c-8b5a-87c3cdbdcfcb", "3": "4ffb77ee-dd77-4c05-8f14-f96a349300ce"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ffb77ee-dd77-4c05-8f14-f96a349300ce": {"__data__": {"text": "were excluded from the model.

and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively \u201cApple\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that a\ufb00ect the amounts reported. Actual results could di\ufb00er\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated \ufb01nancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassi\ufb01ed to conform to\nthe current period\u2019s presentation.\nThe Company\u2019s \ufb01scal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and\nperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to\nbe entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment\nand title and the signi\ufb01cant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales,\ncontrol transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and\nServices net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs.\nWhen observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that re\ufb02ect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations\nwould be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may\nvary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for\nsimilar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identi\ufb01ed up to \nthree\n performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The \ufb01rst performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the\ntime of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\n, Siri\n and Maps. The third\nperformance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each\ndevice. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\nobservable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the\ndelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue\nallocated to the product-related bundled services and unspeci\ufb01ed software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nperiod they are expected to be provided.

Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the\ntime of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company\ndoes not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered\nservices. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based\non the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including\nevaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For\nthird-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company\u2019s other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain\ncontrol of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only\nthe commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other\ncurrent liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes\nexpense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in\nNote 9, \u201cBenefit Plans.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n99,803\n \n$\n94,680\n \n$\n57,411\n \nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding\n16,215,963\n \n16,701,272\n \n17,352,119\n \nEffect of dilutive securities\n109,856\n \n163,647\n \n176,095\n \nWeighted-average diluted shares\n16,325,819\n \n16,864,919\n \n17,528,214\n \nBasic earnings per share\n$\n6.15\n \n$\n5.67\n \n$\n3.31\n \nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n6.11\n \n$\n5.61\n \n$\n3.28\n \nThe Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.\nThe Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classi\ufb01ed and accounted for as available-for-sale.

The Company reports restricted marketable\nsecurities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the shorter of\n40\n years or the remaining life of the building; between \none\n and \n\ufb01ve years\n for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the shorter of the\nlease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets, which range from \nfive\n to \nseven years\n.\n Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $\n8.7\n billion, $\n9.5\n billion and\n$\n9.7\n billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on\nintended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash \ufb02ow hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and subsequently reclassi\ufb01ed into earnings when the hedged transaction a\ufb00ects earnings, and in the same line item in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash \ufb02ow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness\nand recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the\nfair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (\u201cOCI\u201d).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge e\ufb00ectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations line item to which the hedge relates along with o\ufb00setting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange forward\ncontracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge e\ufb00ectiveness and recognizes it in\nother income/(expense), net (\u201cOI&E\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.

The Company classi\ufb01es cash \ufb02ows related to\nderivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company\u2019s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The\nvaluation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company\u2019s debt instruments and all other \ufb01nancial instruments, which generally have counterparties with\nhigh credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. The\ndiscount rates related to the Company\u2019s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit\nin the Company\u2019s leases cannot be readily determined.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the \u201cmanagement\u201d approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by\nmanagement for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company\u2019s reportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan\nand Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater\nChina includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Paci\ufb01c includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other\nreportable segments.

partially o\ufb00set its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose\nnot to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There\ncan be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments,\nand may designate these instruments as cash \ufb02ow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with\nrevenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to \n12\n months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from \ufb02uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may\nenter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting \ufb01rm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the \ufb01nancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the \ufb01nancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \ufb01nancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and signi\ufb01cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the \ufb01nancial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the \ufb01nancial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \ufb01nancial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Further, the design of a control system must re\ufb02ect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the bene\ufb01ts of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all\ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
